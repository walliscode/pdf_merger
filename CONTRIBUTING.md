## Making Changes

### Before You Start

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes in logical, small commits

3. Follow the existing code style and conventions

### Code Style

```

**The tests require:**
- pandoc (for markdown to PDF conversion)
- pdftotext (for PDF text extraction)
- LaTeX (texlive packages for PDF generation)

### Linting

**Run linters to check code quality:**

```bash
# Check for critical errors
flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics

# Check for style issues
flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics

# Run pylint
pylint *.py
```
